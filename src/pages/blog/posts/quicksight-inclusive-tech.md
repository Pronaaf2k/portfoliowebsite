## Mission: Universal Access

QuickSight was developed out of a strong commitment to digital accessibility. The application aims to make the visual world more navigable for colorblind and visually impaired individuals by providing real-time color identification and image-to-text descriptions.

## Technology Stack Rationale

1.  **Flutter:** Chosen for the frontend due to its excellent cross-platform capabilities. This single codebase efficiently compiles to both Android and iOS, maximizing the app's potential reach to users who need it.
2.  **Python (Backend/AI):** The heavy lifting of image analysis and object recognition is handled by a Python-based backend. This separation allows us to use mature AI libraries for image-to-text and specialized vision tasks.
3.  **Firebase/JavaScript:** Firebase handles user authentication and any necessary cloud data storage, managed and integrated primarily through JavaScript bindings, making it a reliable, low-maintenance cloud service.

## Impact

The design philosophy emphasized a clean, high-contrast, and intuitive user experience (UX) to ensure the app itself is usable by its target audience. QuickSight stands as a prime example in my portfolio of leveraging modern technology to achieve a meaningful social impact.
