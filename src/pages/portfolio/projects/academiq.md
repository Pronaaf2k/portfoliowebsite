# ACADEMIQ: AI-Powered Student Systems
  
**ACADEMIQ** is a research-focused project aimed at designing AI-powered, scalable student management systems for higher education institutions. The core idea is to leverage machine learning models to predict student performance, personalize learning paths, and automate administrative overhead.
  
Developed with an emphasis on **AI Concepts** and front-end mockups, the project demonstrates how modern AI/ML frameworks can be integrated into traditional EdTech infrastructure.
  
## ðŸ§© Focus Areas
 
- **Predictive Analytics:** Developing models to forecast student success and identify at-risk learners.
- **Scalability:** Researching architectural patterns that allow the system to handle a large user base.
- **AI-Integration:** Utilizing Python-based deep learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for core intelligence features.
  
## ðŸ’¡ Technologies used
  
- **AI/ML Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Custom ML Algorithms
- **Language:** Python
- **Frontend Mockup:** HTML/CSS
