 13 | ## üßë‚Äçüíª My Expertise and Focus
 14 | 
 15 | My work revolves around merging technology with social impact. This is reflected in the main areas I focus on:
 16 | 
 17 | ### ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
 18 | 
 19 | I constantly explore and experiment with deep learning architectures. This involves training models using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**, primarily focusing on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. My goal is to use AI not just for complex calculations, but for solving real-world problems, such as accessibility challenges.
 20 | 
 21 | ### üåê Full-Stack Web Development
 22 | 
 23 | I build robust and scalable web applications from front to back. I am proficient in **React** for dynamic user interfaces and utilize frameworks like **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development. My preferred backend tools include **Firebase** for rapid prototyping and deployment, with strong skills in **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **Python** for core logic and data handling.
 24 | 
 25 | ### ‚ôø Accessibility and EdTech
 26 | 
 27 | I am deeply committed to developing **Inclusive EdTech** solutions and specialized **accessibility applications**. Projects like **QuickSight** (an accessibility app for colorblind and visually impaired users) are central to my portfolio, aiming to make digital content universally accessible.
 28 | 
 29 | ## üõ†Ô∏è Projects and Contributions
 30 | 
 31 | A significant part of my learning comes from building things. I've developed a range of projects from data pipelines to deep-learning models. You can find detailed descriptions of my featured work like **EDUTrack**, **ACADEMIQ**, and **SuperResAI** in my projects section.
 32 | 
 33 | I believe in continuous learning, which means diving into new libraries, exploring different programming paradigms with languages like **Java** and **C++**, and leveraging data tools like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for processing and analysis.
 34 | 
 35 | ## üé® Design & Creativity
 36 | 
 37 | Beyond the code, I use tools like **Krita**, **Adobe Illustrator**, and **Adobe Premiere Pro** for design and content creation. A keen eye for design ensures my applications are not only functional but also intuitive and visually appealing.
 38 | 
 39 | I'm Samiyeel Alim Binaaf, and I'm always looking for the next challenge that combines technical complexity with meaningful impact.
