 I am Samiyeel, a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) undergraduate at **North South University**, driven by a passion for **AI/ML, digital accessibility, and full-stack web development**. My focus is on building practical, impactful, and inclusive software solutions.

 ## üßë‚Äçüíª My Expertise and Focus
 
 My work revolves around merging technology with social impact. This is reflected in the main areas I focus on:
 
 ### ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
 
 I constantly explore and experiment with deep learning architectures. This involves training models using **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**, primarily focusing on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. My goal is to use AI not just for complex calculations, but for solving real-world problems, such as accessibility challenges.

 ### üåê Full-Stack Web Development
 
 I build robust and scalable web applications from front to back. I am proficient in **React** for dynamic user interfaces and utilize frameworks like **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development. My preferred backend tools include **Firebase** for rapid prototyping and deployment, with strong skills in **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **Python** for core logic and data handling.
 
 ### ‚ôø Accessibility and EdTech
 
 I am deeply committed to developing **Inclusive EdTech** solutions and specialized **accessibility applications**. Projects like **QuickSight** (an accessibility app for colorblind and visually impaired users) are central to my portfolio, aiming to make digital content universally accessible.
 
 ## üõ†Ô∏è Projects and Contributions
 
 A significant part of my learning comes from building things. I've developed a range of projects from data pipelines to deep-learning models. You can find detailed descriptions of my featured work like **EDUTrack**, **ACADEMIQ**, and **SuperResAI** in my projects section.
 
 I believe in continuous learning, which means diving into new libraries, exploring different programming paradigms with languages like **Java** and **C++**, and leveraging data tools like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for processing and analysis.
 
 ## üé® Design & Creativity
 
 Beyond the code, I use tools like **Krita**, **Adobe Illustrator**, and **Adobe Premiere Pro** for design and content creation. A keen eye for design ensures my applications are not only functional but also intuitive and visually appealing.

 I'm Samiyeel Alim Binaaf, and I'm always looking for the next challenge that combines technical complexity with meaningful impact.
